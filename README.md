Slot Machine Project using import random
This is a project that I created as part of my learning journey in Python. 
It is a slot machine game that allows users to bet on multiple lines 
and win prizes based on the symbols that are displayed on the screen.

Usage
To run the game, simply run the main.py file in your Python environment. 
The game will prompt you to enter the amount you want to deposit, the number of lines to bet on, 
and the amount you want to bet on each line. Then, it will spin the slot machine and display the results on the screen.

Credits
This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial "Python Slot Machine Tutorial" by Tech with Tim. 
I followed his tutorial to learn how to create a basic slot machine game in Python
and made some modifications to the code to suit my needs.
